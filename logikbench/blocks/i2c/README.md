I2C
=============================

I2C is a two-wire, bi-directional serial bus that provides a simple and efficient method of data exchange between devices. It is most suitable for applications requiring occasional communication over a short distance between many devices. The I2C standard is a true multi-master bus including collision detection and arbitration that prevents data corruption if two or more masters attempt to control the bus simultaneously.
