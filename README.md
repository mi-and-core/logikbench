LogicBenchy
==========================================================

LogicBenchy is a technology agnostic RTL design benchmark suite leveraging the SiliconCompiler project to automate running RTL benchmarks to a diverse set of compiler targets.

The LogicBenchy project was designed to address inaccurate:
- strawman spreadsheets used by ASIC and FPGA system architects
- single value gate-density numbers provided by foundries
- back of the envelope process scaling estimations
- non-standard vendor IP benchmarks with a long list of footnotes
- non-stardard vendor tool benchmarks bound by NDAs
